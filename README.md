# Bus Finder

This project utilizes three [Trimet API](https://developer.trimet.org/ws_docs/) endpoints to provide the following information
to a user:

* all bus stops near your current location
* which lines service those bus stops
* the real-time locations and routes of buses (updated every 4 seconds)
* the arrival times for those buses at the nearby stops.
